<p>Hello and thank you for visiting my GitHub website.

<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h1>

<p>I have been born in 1993 (Hamburg) and went to school in central Hamburg. After primary and secondary school, I went to the G16 - grammar school. There I focussed on electrical engineering, and finished my courses in 2012. After this, I started studying electrical engineering at the HAW Hamburg and will finish my bachelors in 2016.</p>

<a id="working-life" class="anchor" href="#working-life" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working life</h2>

<p>During my time at school and university I did several internships and work experiences. Some of the more relevant ones are listed here:</p>

<ul>
<li>2013/14: 12 wk internship at the DESY in Hamburg (GER), afterwards I continued working as a student assistant</li>
<li>2015: 22 wk internship at REAPsystems ltd. in Southampton (UK)</li>
</ul>

<a id="spare-time--projects" class="anchor" href="#spare-time--projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spare time / Projects</h2>

<p>In my spare time I like to do sports, such as running and swimming. Also I like to attend family events. I spend most of my spare time working on hobby projects, like word and nixie clocks and designing hard- and software. Some projects are to be listed here later on. Reading articles about other peoples projects or new electronic developments, is something, that I like as much as rolling out my own projects.</p>
