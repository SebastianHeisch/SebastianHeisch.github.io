After primary and secondary school, I went to the G16 - grammar school. There I focussed on electrical engineering, and finished my courses in 2012. After this, I started studying electrical engineering at the HAW Hamburg and will finish my bachelors in 2016.\r\n\r\n## Working life\r\nDuring my time at school and university I did several internships and work experiences. Some of the more relevant ones are listed here:\r\n* 2013/14: 12 wk internship at the DESY in Hamburg (GER), afterwards I continued working as a student assistant\r\n* 2015: 22 wk internship at REAPsystems ltd. in Southampton (UK)\r\n\r\n## Spare time / Projects\r\nIn my spare time I like to do sports, such as running and swimming. Also I like to attend family events. I spend most of my spare time working on hobby projects, like word and nixie clocks and designing hard- and software. Some projects are to be listed here later on. Reading articles about other peoples projects or new electronic developments, is something, that I like as much as rolling out my own projects.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
